//     In our next task, we want you to have a go at creating your own object literal to represent one of your favorite bands.The required properties are:

//         name: A string representing the band name.

//                             split: A number representing the year the band split up, or false if they are still together.
//                                 albums: An array representing the albums released by the band.Each array item should be an object containing the following members:
//         name: A string representing the name of the album.
//             released: A number representing the year the album was released.
// Include at least two albums in the albums array.

// then write a string to the variable bandInfo, which will contain a small biography detailing their name, nationality, years active, and style, and the title and release date of their first album.
